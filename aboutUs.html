        <p></br><em>Hobbies </em> </p>
        <p></br>When I have free time I like to travel and visit new places. I love 
        exploring the outdoors. Also in free time I love reading different books and doing karate.
    In fact karate is my favorite sport and I used to go to the comnpettions where I got
the third place in Kosovo but now I don't have much free time to prepare and go to the competitions.   </p>
